# Cost-Function
An expansion of research done by Max Norfolk in 2020 to include the gamut of primitive recursive (PR) functions.

The cost a postive integer *m* for *m > 1* is defined as the minimum of C<sub>S</sub>(a)+C<sub>S</sub>(b) such that *a* and *b* are positive integers and *m = a * b* for a primitive recursive function * &in; S. Regardless of *S*, C<sub>S</sub>(1) = 1. This function is similar to Komgorov complixities, however it is computable. 

I am so far approaching this function from one form of induction (on the input) but another approach can be done through induction on the output.
